## DATA 512 Final project

## Exploring the racial/ethnic disparities in police killings in the US

### Preliminary project proposal

The issue of racial bias in policing system in the US has been a widely discussed and debated topic not only in the US, but across nations. Many works have been conducted in the past that looked for patterns in the arrests, stop-and-frisk and killings across different races and ethnic groups. I would like to understand the effect of police killings. For the final project, I would like to explore racial/ethnic disparities in the police killings in the US based on the data consisting of ~8,500 killings from 2013 till date.Understanding how these police killings affect different racial groups and the extent of racial bias in these killings, if any, is an important topic that has a very strong human-centered outlook. Any insights on police violence and racial equity in these killings will serve as an evidence that will support changes to policies and reforms around training and hiring of law enforcement officers.
