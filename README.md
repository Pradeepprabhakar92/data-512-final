## Abstract

This project analyzed police killings in the US between 2013 and 2019 for racial disparities, if any, at a nation level and across states. Understanding the impact of police killings across different racial/ethnic groups has a strong human centered outlook which served as the primary motivation. We first wanted to understand if individuals in minority racial/ethnic groups are disproportionately killed by the police. We observed that the distribution of killings across races differed significantly from the expected distribution based on arrests estimates, and Blacks and Asians are killed at a rate higher than expected. We then focused on whether unarmed individuals in minority racial/ethnic groups are disproportionately killed by the police and observed that the distribution of unarmed killings across races differed significantly from the expected distribution. Blacks and Hispanics are killed at a higher rate than expected despite being unarmed. We also observed racial disparity across states in the US where on an average, Native Americans, Pacific Islanders and Blacks have a victim rate per million population much higher than the national average. The Black-White disparity was observed in 44 of the 50 states, with Utah having the largest difference between Black and White victim rates.

* [Uniform Crime Reporting](https://www.fbi.gov/services/cjis/ucr/) - The FBI’s Uniform Crime Reporting (UCR) provides arrests estimates at a nation level by race and ethnicity. The arrests data will be used as a benchmark to analyze racial disparity in the killings.

## Research questions explored

* Are individuals in minority racial/ethnic groups likely to be killed by the police disproportionately? 
    * Null Hypothesis: Rate of police killings across the races are consistent with the rate of crime arrests across the races
* Are individuals in minority racial/ethnic groups likely to be killed by the police disproportionately when unarmed during an encounter? 
    * Null Hypothesis: Rate of police killings involving unarmed victims across races are consistent with the rate of overall police killings across the races
* Are individuals in minority racial/ethnic groups disproportionately killed by the police across the states?
	* Which states exhibit a high degree of racial disparity in police killings, if any?


## Key Findings

* Asians are killed by the police at a rate 1.3 times higher than expected and for Blacks it is 1.3 times higher

![Actual vs expected ratio of police killings across races](output/q1_actual_vs_expected_ratio.png)

* An unarmed black or African American is likely to be killed at a rate ~20% more than expected, while for Hispanics it is higher by ~10%

* Across the states, Pacific Islanders, Native Americans and Blacks are killed at a rate much higher than the national mean of 3.7 /million
